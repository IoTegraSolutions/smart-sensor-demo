# Smart Sensor System – IoT Device to Cloud with Real-Time Dashboard

A demonstration of a **complete IoT workflow** from ultra low-power sensor hardware, through secure cloud messaging, to a live, interactive web-based dashboard.

> **Note:** This is a **demonstration portfolio** version of a production system developed by IoTegra Solutions. It omits proprietary implementation details, hardware specifics, and source code.

## 📦 System Overview

The system connects environmental sensors to a low-power microcontroller running proprietary firmware. Data is securely published using MQTT over TLS to a cloud endpoint, received by a local subscriber application, stored as time-series data, and visualized in a custom web dashboard.
